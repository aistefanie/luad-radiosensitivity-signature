# LUAD Radiosensitivity-Associated Gene Signature

This repository contains the analysis code used to construct and characterize a radiosensitivity-associated gene signature in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).  
The study integrates bulk transcriptomic data, single-cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning approaches to investigate the prognostic relevance, immune features, and cellular origins of radiosensitivity-associated programs.

## Overview

Radiotherapy response in LUAD is highly heterogeneous and influenced by both tumor-intrinsic transcriptional programs and the tumor microenvironment.  
In this work, we developed an integrative computational framework to:

- Derive a radiosensitivity-associated gene signature from transcriptomic patterns
- Evaluate its association with clinical outcomes and immune characteristics
- Resolve its cellular context using single-cell RNA sequencing, with a focus on cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) functional states

This repository provides the scripts and configuration files necessary to reproduce the main analytical steps reported in the study.
